# Hillel_Python_Pro_course

Hi there! One of the biggest pillars of my programming knowledge was built by the Hillel school in Odessa(Ukraine) and by it`s great teachers. 
In this repository you can find some projects I was found of and created while learning. They are fully complete and functioning web-projects and telegram-bots.
Tried to provide all necessary explanations and documentation there.
The final project of whole course was "Wallet Keeper Bot".

Thanks for attention! Good luck and have a great day!
